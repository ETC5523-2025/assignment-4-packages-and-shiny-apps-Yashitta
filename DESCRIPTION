Description: Provides tools and an interactive Shiny dashboard to explore
    quarantine/outbreak risk under different epidemic scenarios. Includes
    datasets of outbreak probabilities and timing summaries across grids of
    R0, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and vaccination coverage, plus helper
    functions for slicing scenarios and plotting risk profiles. The dashboard
    visualises probabilities and timing (median and tail days) via lines,
    heatmaps and summary tables.
